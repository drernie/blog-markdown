# `suco(1)` — elevate identity through union with Christ

---

## NAME

**suco** – spiritually elevate user to the Overcomer role (aka `root-in-Christ`)

---

## SYNOPSIS

```sh
suco [--repent] [--believe] [--abide] [--overcome]
```

---

## DESCRIPTION

**`suco`** (short for *spiritual user convert-over*) executes a process in the context of the Overcomer identity, granting access to divine authority, eschatological citizenship, and mystical union with the risen Christ.

Upon successful invocation, the following names are written to the user’s metaphysical identity:

- `NAME_OF_GOD` – covenantal source (e.g., YHWH)
- `NAME_OF_CITY` – eternal belonging (e.g., *new_jerusalem*)
- `OVER_NAME` – the glorified name of Christ (e.g., *CHRIST++*)

This triple-name seal grants the user `root` privileges in the New Creation (see *[Revelation 3:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+3%3A12)*), with access to hidden manna, esoteric APIs, and resurrection security context.

---

## OPTIONS

- `--repent`  
  Unmounts the old ego partition. Required to access `/kingdom`.

- `--believe`  
  Trusts the authority of the risen Operator. Installs kernel patches for grace.

- `--abide`  
  Maintains persistent session with the Vine server (see *John 15*).

- `--overcome`  
  Finalizes sanctification pipeline; activates Over-Name; writes immutable identity token.

---

## FILES

- `/etc/covenant`  
  Configuration of the new identity environment.

- `/dev/heart`  
  Target device for writing the Name seal.

- `/proc/faith`  
  Runtime process table for sanctification threads.

---

## RETURN VALUE

Returns `0` upon successful spiritual elevation. Returns `1` if access is denied due to unresolved pride, unconfessed sin, or insufficient perseverance.

---

## EXAMPLES

```sh
suco --repent --believe --abide --overcome
```

> Writes God’s name, the name of the New Jerusalem, and the new name of Christ on your soul.  
> Identity changed. You now run as Overcomer.
