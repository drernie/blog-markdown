## 1. Verse 1  

I’ve been bound inside to [die while still a bride](https://biblehub.com/judges/11-30.htm)
Searching far and wide for how to save my life
I cannot save my life

---

## 2. Pre-Chorus  

So I will [dare to lose my soul](https://biblehub.com/mark/8-35.htm),  
If that is the only way to  
Lead them straight to you, and  

---

## 3. Chorus  

I’m lost in the bleeding
That I ain't long for this world
Going to Golgotha
Ain't gonna be easy  
But it leads them straight to You
Now I’m heading home  
Like Jephthah’s girl

---

## 4. Verse 2  

I don’t fight the altar  
I don’t fear the flame
I just want a life that overcomes the grave

---

## 5. Pre-Chorus  

Yeah, I’ll dare to lose my soul,  
If that is the only way to  
Lead them straight to you, and  

---

## 6. Chorus  

I’m lost in the bleeding,  
That I ain't long for this world
Going to Golgotha
Ain't gonna be easy  
But it leads them straight to You
Now I’m heading home  
Like Jephthah’s girl.

## 7. Bridge  

I will dare to lose my soul,  
If that is the only way to  
Lead them straight to you, and
You've prepared for me a place
When I see You face to face,  
“Well done, faithful child.”  
Now I’m lifted home,  
Like Jephthah’s girl.  

## 8. Chorus  (2X)

I’m lost in the bleeding,  
That I ain't long for this world
Going to Golgotha
Ain't gonna be easy  
But it leads them straight to You
Now I’m heading home  
Like Jephthah’s girl.

## Stylistic Notes  

- **Internal Rhyme & Repetition:** The verse lines echo each other (“fire / desire,” “altar / offer”), creating lyrical cohesion like *The Prodigal*.  
- **Phrasal Return:** “Still I…” and “Now I…” establish rhythmic repetition matching Josiah Queen’s melodic phrasing.  
- **Thematic Arc:** The song moves from vow and fire → surrender and flame → recognition and home, mirroring Jephthah’s daughter as a **type of Christ** (see [John 12:25](https://biblehub.com/john/12-25.htm)).  
- **Emotional Tone:** The diction shifts from pleading to peace — she *chooses* the cost, embracing the paradox of redemptive loss.
