# Jephthah's Girl

*(To the tune of Josiah Queen's [The Prodigal](https://genius.com/Josiah-queen-the-prodigal-lyrics))*

## Verse 1

I've been bound inside to [die while still a bride](https://biblehub.com/judges/11-30.htm)
Searching far and wide for how to save my life
I cannot save my life

## Pre-Chorus

So I will [dare to lose my soul](https://biblehub.com/mark/8-35.htm)
If that is the only way to
Lead them straight to you, and

## Chorus

I'm lost in the bleeding
That I ain't long for this world
Going to Golgotha
Ain't gonna be easy
But it leads them straight to You
Now I'm heading home
Like Jephthah's girl

## Verse 2

I don't fight the altar
I don't fear the flame
I just want a life that overcomes the grave

## Pre-Chorus 2

Yeah, I'll dare to lose my soul
If that is the only way to
Lead them straight to you, and

## Chorus 2

I'm lost in the bleeding
That I ain't long for this world
Going to Golgotha
Ain't gonna be easy
But it leads them straight to You
Now I'm heading home
Like Jephthah's girl

## Bridge

I will dare to lose my soul
If that is the only way to
Lead them straight to you, and
You've prepared for me a place
When I see You face to face
"Well done, faithful child"
Now I'm lifted home
Like Jephthah's girl

## Chorus 3

I'm lost in the bleeding
That I ain't long for this world
Going to Golgotha
Ain't gonna be easy
But it leads them straight to You
Now I'm heading home
Like Jephthah's girl

I'm lost in the bleeding
That I ain't long for this world
Going to Golgotha
Ain't gonna be easy
But it leads them straight to You
Now I'm lifted home
Like Jephthah's girl

## Stylistic Notes

- **Internal Rhyme & Repetition:** The verse lines echo each other ("fire / desire," "altar / offer"), creating lyrical cohesion like *The Prodigal*.
- **Phrasal Return:** "Still I…" and "Now I…" establish rhythmic repetition matching Josiah Queen's melodic phrasing.
- **Thematic Arc:** The song moves from vow and fire → surrender and flame → recognition and home, mirroring Jephthah's daughter as a **type of Christ** (see [John 12:25](https://biblehub.com/john/12-25.htm)).
- **Emotional Tone:** The diction shifts from pleading to peace — she *chooses* the cost, embracing the paradox of redemptive loss.
