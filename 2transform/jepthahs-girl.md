#### Whom he sacrificed to the LORD to fulfill a vow

[*Verse 1*]

I've been bound inside to [die an unwed bride](https://biblehub.com/judges/11-37.htm)
Searching far and wide for how to save my life
I cannot [save my life](https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-25.htm)

[*Pre-Chorus*]

So I will [dare to lose my soul](https://biblehub.com/mark/8-35.htm)
If that is [the only hope](https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-39.htm) to
Lead them [straight to you](https://biblehub.com/john/1-23.htm), and

[*Chorus*]

I'm lost in a feeling
That I ain't long for this world
Going to [Golgotha](https://biblehub.com/john/19-17.htm)
Ain't gonna be easy
But it leads them straight to You
So I'm heading home
Like a Jephthah's girl

[*Verse 2*]

I don't [fight the altar](https://biblehub.com/romans/12-1.htm)
I don't [fear the flame](https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-7.htm)
I just want a life that [overcomes the grave](https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-11.htm)

[*Pre-Chorus 2*]

Yeah, I'll dare to lose my soul
If that is the only way to
Lead them straight to you, and

[*Chorus 2*]

I'm lost in a feeling
That I ain't long for this world
Going to Golgotha
Ain't gonna be easy
But it leads them straight to You
So I'm heading home
Like a Jephthah's girl

[*Bridge*]

I will dare to lose my soul
If that is the only way to
Lead them straight to you, and
You've [prepared for me a place](https://biblehub.com/john/14-2.htm)
When I see You [face to face](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-12.htm)
"[Well done](https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-21.htm), faithful child"
Now I'm [lifted home](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearer,_My_God,_to_Thee)
Like a Jephthah's girl

[*Chorus 3*]

I'm lost in a feeling
That I ain't long for this world
Going to Golgotha
Ain't gonna be easy
But it leads them straight to You
So I'm heading home
Like a Jephthah's girl

I'm lost in a feeling
That I ain't long for this world
Going to Golgotha
Ain't gonna be easy
But it leads them straight to You
Now I'm lifted home
Like a Jephthah's girl

## Appendix: Jephthah's Daughter as a Type of Christ

### The Story

In [Judges 11:29-40](https://biblehub.com/judges/11.htm), Jephthah makes a rash vow to the Lord: if God grants him victory over the Ammonites, he will sacrifice as a burnt offering "whatever comes out of the door of my house to meet me" upon his return. Tragically, his only child—his daughter—comes dancing out to greet him with tambourines and celebration.

When Jephthah tears his clothes in anguish and tells her of his vow, her response is extraordinary: ["My father, if you have given your word to the LORD, do to me according to what has gone out of your mouth"](https://biblehub.com/judges/11-36.htm) (Judges 11:36). She asks only for two months to go into the mountains with her friends and "weep because I will never marry" ([Judges 11:37](https://biblehub.com/judges/11-37.htm)).

After this time, "she returned to her father, and he did to her according to his vow" ([Judges 11:39](https://biblehub.com/judges/11-39.htm)). The text establishes an annual custom in Israel: "the daughters of Israel went year by year to lament the daughter of Jephthah" for four days ([Judges 11:40](https://biblehub.com/judges/11-40.htm)).

#### 10. **The Greater Reality**

- Christ died to prepare His bride, the Church, for the wedding feast of the Lamb ([Revelation 19:7-9](https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-7.htm))
- Her sacrifice pointed forward to the One who would die to gain His bride

### The Theological Pattern

Jephthah's daughter embodies what theologians call a "type"—an Old Testament person, event, or institution that foreshadows a greater New Testament reality. Her story asks the question that Christ answers:

**What if someone willingly embraced death, trusting that loss of life would lead others to God?**

She modeled the principle Jesus would later articulate: ["Unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit"](https://biblehub.com/john/12-24.htm) (John 12:24).

Her story is tragic precisely because it is incomplete. She had to die. Christ's death, however, opens the way to resurrection life—the same path of self-giving love, but with the promise that ["whoever loses his life for my sake will find it"](https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-25.htm) fulfilled in resurrection power.

This is why her story haunts us: she shows us the **pattern of Christ** before Christ came to fulfill it. She walked the Via Dolorosa of Judges 11, so that we might recognize the path when God Himself walked it to Golgotha.
