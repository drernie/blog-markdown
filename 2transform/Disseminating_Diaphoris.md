# Disseminating Diaphoris: A Skit with Moody, Blanchard, and Morrison

**Cast:**  
- **Moody** – rugged urban evangelist (practical, no-nonsense)  
- **Blanchard** – reform-minded intellectual (serious, incisive)  
- **Morrison** – holiness mystic and revival preacher (warm, spiritually oriented)  

*Scene opens in a cozy study. A fire crackles. Books and coffee cups sit on a round table.*

## Scene 1: The Proposal

**Blanchard** *(leaning forward)*  
Folks, this *Diaphoric Participation*—where the student actively **lives into** union with Christ, not just **learns about** it—is an intriguing remedy for our overly Platonic schools. Thoughts?

**Moody** *(stroking his chin)*  
So we’re teaching *participation*—meaning folks go out and do ministry **as learning**? I like that. No more dusty lectures where folks fall asleep counting syllogisms.

**Morrison** *(smiling)*  
Yes, but Diaphoris isn’t just “do.” It’s an ongoing, Spirit‑driven exchange with Christ. Praying together *while* learning—and letting the Spirit speak through our work.

---

## Scene 2: Tensions Arise

**Moody**  
Alright—but what if they go out and muck it up? If a student preaches before they’ve studied doctrine, we get nonsense gospel!

**Blanchard**  
Precisely. We need theological depth *within* participation. Not mere pop‑up preachers, but thoughtful ministers. Diaphoris demands reflection in the **field**, not in the classroom only.

**Morrison**  
And it demands suffused prayer. We apprentice *in* Christ through teaching, service, and communal prayer. It's messy—enthusiastic, even holy chaos.

---

## Scene 3: The New Model

*(Blanchard stands and draws in the air convex arches, labeling each component.)*

- **Moody’s Corner**: *Mission‑Practice Labs*  
  - Students launch urban recovery support during class.

- **Blanchard’s Corner**: *Reflection Forums*  
  - Evening discussions integrating theology with today’s experience.

- **Morrison’s Corner**: *House of Prayer Sessions*  
  - Weekly chapel, fasting, journaling—praising through academic grind.

**Moody**  
So the student preaches in a shelter, then comes back and we unpack from the Bible and the moment?

**Blanchard**  
Exactly. We sharpen theology *with* the hammer of mission.

**Morrison**  
And we listen—heart and mind—to the Spirit revealing Christ in the real world.

---

## Scene 4: Gentle Humor

**Moody** *(grinning)*  
So no more snooze‑fest lectures. Instead, pitfalls, coffee stains, and holy surprise?

**Blanchard**  
Yes, but for an educated audience—no “Preacher, tell us your feelings” emptiness.

**Morrison**  
And every student walks out practicing holiness—not just reading about it.

---

## Scene 5: Final Word

**Moody**  
I built schools to mobilize workers for the harvest. Diaphoris could actually send them out **alive** to harvest.

**Blanchard**  
It could guard against sloppy doctrine and platonic abstraction. Head, heart, and hands connect.

**Morrison**  
And Christ’s Spirit remains center—not system. It’s education woven into the fabric of *communion*.

*(They nod, the fire dims, and the scene fades on hopeful reflection.)*

---

## Curtain Call – What We Learned

1. **Diaphoric Participation** breaks the lecture/classroom-mind trap.  
2. It **integrates learning through doing**, thoughtful reflection, and spiritual formation.  
3. It addresses the Platonic problem by *re-embodying* theology in lived practice.  
4. And yes—it’s gloriously messy, but that's where education gets holy again.

> **“Teach them Christ.”** Not *about* Him. Not *rules*. But *immersed* in His life, shaped by the Spirit, launched into mission—*that’s* education on fire.

# Appendix: A Guide to Founding Diaphoretic Seminaries  
*By “Michael Horn” (inspired by the disruptive innovation framework)*

---

## Introduction

Theological education is ripe for disruption. Traditional seminaries were designed in a time of institutional trust, denominational stability, and industrial-age pedagogy. Today’s aspiring Christian leaders face a fragmented culture, a flattened digital world, and a crisis of spiritual formation.

The solution? **Diaphoretic Seminaries**—institutions grounded in *Diaphoric Participation*, where students not only study Christ but participate *in* Christ dynamically, contextually, and holistically.

This is not reform. This is a **reinvention**.

---

## 1. Define the *Job To Be Done*

**Traditional Seminaries:**  
- Credential clergy for pulpits  
- Transmit theological systems  
- Maintain denominational identity  

**Diaphoretic Seminaries:**  
- Form disciples to live **in Christ**  
- Equip learners for real-time, real-world **mission**  
- Cultivate ongoing **union, reflection, and innovation** in diverse contexts

> Ask: *What job is the learner “hiring” seminary to do?*

---

## 2. Core Disruptive Design Principles

### A. **Modular + Missional**
- Embed theological learning within lived ministry contexts  
- Replace classrooms with “formation pods”: learning + reflection + praxis

### B. **Low-cost, High-access**
- Leverage digital platforms, local mentors, and asynchronous content  
- Flip faculty into *guides* and *co-discerners*, not gatekeepers

### C. **Spirit-led Iteration**
- Build agile systems that prioritize spiritual listening over academic inertia  
- Let curriculum emerge from *communal discernment* and contextual needs

---

## 3. Institutional DNA

### **Structure**
- Flat leadership: apostolic teams > academic deans  
- Distributed campuses: home groups, co-working spaces, even laundromats  

### **Funding**
- Micro-tuition models (students earn while they learn)  
- Community-supported, donor-mission-backed (think: Patreon for prophets)

### **Credentialing**
- Replace degrees with **formation portfolios** and **missional impact logs**  
- Align with church networks, not accrediting bodies (at least initially)

---

## 4. Curriculum Framework

### Three Integrated Streams:
1. **Participation**: Union with Christ via spiritual rhythms, sacraments, liturgies  
2. **Practice**: Ministry immersion—justice, evangelism, peacemaking, entrepreneurship  
3. **Perception**: Scriptural reflection, theological imagination, cultural discernment  

**All in context. All in community. All in Christ.**

---

## 5. Pilot Strategy: Start Small, Stay Relational

- Launch with 12–20 students in one city or network  
- Use cohort-based mentoring with cross-functional facilitators  
- Build quick feedback loops: spiritual fruit > academic metrics

---

## 6. Scaling the Movement

- Open-source the model: licenses for other churches or networks  
- Train multipliers, not just graduates  
- Focus on *depth and diffusion*, not prestige or permanence

> “If you build something worth replicating, it will spread like yeast.”

---

## Conclusion: The Diaphoretic Disruption

A Diaphoretic Seminary doesn’t prepare students for pulpits—it *prepares the Church to become the pulpit*. It doesn’t transfer knowledge—it **incarnates wisdom**. It doesn’t train elites—it **releases the body of Christ**.

**Disruption is coming. Let it be holy. Let it be participatory. Let it burn.**
