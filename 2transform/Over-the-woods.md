# Over The Woods ARC

## Alternate Redemptive Conclusion, as Act II of Into The Woods

**See also the backstory: Mother Gothel versus the Royal Family**.

### Scene 1: Back In The Woods

*The Baker enters from downstage left. Head down, muttering to himself, apparently deep in thought*.

*Mysterious Stranger enters from upstage right, and watches the Baker from behind a tree*.

**MYSTERIOUS STRANGER**: Huh!

**BAKER**: [*startling erect*] What was that?

**MYSTERIOUS STRANGER**: [*leaping in front of the Baker*] When first I appeared, I seem nothing serious. But now that I’m known, I’m actually [specious](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/specious).

**BAKER**: Father! Wait, you’re alive? And also: isn’t “specious” the same as “not serious”?

**MYSTERIOUS STRANGER**: Technically, I am not alive, merely not dead. Also -- sadly -- I am technically specious, not merely “not serious.”

**BAKER**: Meaning, you were actively deceiving me? Beyond just pretending to be dead?

**MYSTERIOUS STRANGER**: It’s... not that simple. Anyway, the important question is: why are you back in the woods? I thought you were living happily ever after with your wife and my grandson!

**BAKER**: It’s... not that simple. [*turns to walk away*]

**MYSTERIOUS STRANGER**: Son! Please... stay.

**BAKER**: [*whirling*] Stay! You have the nerve to ask me to stay? After you left me! Left me to raise myself. Left me to woo and win a wife with no clue about how to be married. Left me to raise a son with no clue of what it feels like to have a father.

**MYSTERIOUS STRANGER**: [*quietly*] Yes. Stay... so you can find out.

*The Baker stares at his father for a long moment, then shakes his head and walks away.*

**MYSTERIOUS STRANGER**: Wait...

*The Baker doesn’t seem to hear him, and keeps walking.*

**MYSTERIOUS STRANGER**: [*calling after him*] I don’t blame you for walking out on me...

*The Baker exits.*

**MYSTERIOUS STRANGER**: [*to himself*] But why did you walk out on your wife and child to revisit the woods?

### Scene 2: The Castle Grounds

*Rapunzel is sitting at the edge of the garden, crying to herself.*

*The Baker, lost in thought, wanders in from the forest*.

**BAKER**: [*bowing*] Forgive me, your Highness. I did not realize the woods had ended.

**RAPUNZEL**: [*angrily facing him*] Don’t say that! The woods have never ended! I will never forgive her!

**BAKER**: [*recognizing his sister*] Ra... Rapunzel.

**RAPUNZEL**: Go ahead, laugh. Everyone laughs at my name.

**BAKER**: But I love that name!

**RAPUNZEL**: Spare me your empty platitudes. I get enough of them from my Prince. Sometimes even from the other one... [*turns to leave*]

**BAKER**: Please, stay...

**RAPUNZEL**: [*whirling*] Stay! All I ever did was stay. Stay in the tower. Stay on the island. Stay in the castle. Stay! Stay! Stay! I’m sick of staying.

**BAKER**: [*exploding*] I’m sick of it too! Come. Run away with me to the forest.

**RAPUNZEL**: [*scornful*] And why should I run away with you?

**BAKER**: [*stunned*] Has nobody told you?

**RAPUNZEL**: [*mocking*] Told me what? That you are rich and powerful?

**BAKER**: [*quietly*] No. That I am your brother.

*Rapunzel stares in shock, then faints*.

**STEWARD**: [*offstage*] Rapunzel! Time for your afternoon tea with the King.

*The Baker looks around for agonizing seconds, then hauls Rapunzel onto his shoulder and dives back into the woods*.

*Moments later, Cinderella walks onstage. She glances at the bench, and notices a tuft of long blonde hair. She picks it up and gazes thoughtfully into the woods*.

**STEWARD**: [*offstage*] Rapunzel! Cinderella! Time for your afternoon tea with the King.

*Cinderella glances for a second time at the woods, then sighs, pockets the hair, and heads back into the castle*.

### Scene 3: The Baker’s House

*The Baker's Wife dabs at her eyes. She has obviously been crying. She straightens her clothes and picks up the baby as Little Red Riding Hood knocks and enters*.

**RED**: I wish for a loaf of bread to take to my grannie.

**WIFE**: [*awkwardly*] Sure. Whatever. Help yourself.

**RED**: [*looking at her closely*] Are you okay?

**WIFE**: I’m fine!

**RED**: You don't look fine. Have you been crying?

**WIFE**: No! [*sniffle*] Well, maybe.

**RED**: Where... where's the Baker?

**WIFE**: He... He’s just... He went...

*The Baker's Wife starts crying. The baby starts crying. Red looks back and forth between them, unsure what to do. She starts to panic.*

**RED**: Waaah!

*This snaps the Baker's Wife out of her misery. She grabs a sticky bun then stuffs it in Red's mouth. She dries her tears on the apron, picks up the baby, and sits down on a rocking chair making soothing noises.*

*For a moment, all is quiet. Then she begins to speak in a soft voice.*

**WIFE**: It’s... not his fault. It’s probably his father’s. He’s just... not good with children. And I... I guess I’m not very patient.

**RED**: Did he... hit you?

**WIFE**: [*laughing*] No, nothing like that. But... well, I hadn’t been getting very much sleep, because of the baby. I just asked him to watch the baby for an hour so I could take a nap. He agreed, and I had just gotten back to sleep when he woke me because the baby was crying. I was angry and said:

---

**WIFE**:  Why do you have to be so useless?

**BAKER**: Me? At least I didn’t run away like my father did.

**WIFE**: Well maybe you should, if you’re never going to help with the child.

**BAKER**: If that’s all you think I’m good for, then maybe I should.

**WIFE**: Fine!

**BAKER**: Fine!

---

**RED**:  And he just left? But where?

**WIFE**: I.. I don’t know...

*She starts to cry again, but then the baby does too. She gets ahold of herself and calms the child*.

**WIFE**: The baby was crying so I had to get up and change his diaper. By the time I finished, and got the baby back to sleep my husband was long gone. I was so tired I just sat and cried. When I stopped, well, you were here.

**RED**: And you have no idea where he could have gone?

**WIFE**: Well, he did take his scarf. So that could mean he’s gone into the woods.

**RED**: Excellent! Then you can come with me to grandmother's, and she can help us find him.

**WIFE**: What? Really?

**RED**: Of course. She's lived in the woods her whole life. She even knows how to survive off the path. I'm sure she can help. C'mon, let's go!

*Red grabs the Baker’s Wife by the hand and pulls her and the baby after her as they exit*.

### Scene 4: Still In The Woods

**BAKER**: ... and I only found out about it when the Witch asked us to make the potion that restored her youth, and enabled us to have a child.

**RAPUNZEL**: [*still in shock*] I... have a brother. The Witch... wasn't my mother.

**BAKER**: Rapunzel... are you okay?

**RAPUNZEL**: [*hysterical*] Okay? Okay!? I was traded away for greens, locked in a tower, banished to a desert island, and now trapped in a castle with a man I hardly even know, with a sister-in-law who is little Miss Perfect. Why wouldn’t I be okay?

*The Baker stares at her tirade in shock*.
*Rapunzel starts back, afraid he is going to run off*.
*Instead, he steps forward... and gives her a hug*.

**BAKER**: I... am so sorry. For everything. I didn’t realize you had it so much worse than me.

*Rapunzel freezes... then sinks into his arms and cries*.

**BAKER**: There, there. Let it all out. Take your time.

**STEWARD**: [*offstage*] She came this way, I’m sure of it. Look, there’s a long blonde hair.

**BAKER**: Whoops, no time left. We have to hide.

**RAPUNZEL**: But where?

**BAKER**: Look! Another beanstalk?

**RAPUNZEL**: Beanstalk? How could that help us?

**BAKER**: You've never... nobody told... forget about it. Hurry. Here, let me help you up...

*They exit stage left*.

### Scene 5: Giants In The Sky

*Rapunzel and the Baker creep in slowly from Stage Left. Loud cries sound in the distance*.

**RAPUNZEL**: What is that? [*peering*]

**BAKER**: It looks like a... giant!

**RAPUNZEL**: No... a giantess. She’s... she’s crying. [*starts to walk towards her*]

*The Baker grabs her by the hand*.

**BAKER**: No! Stop!

**RAPUNZEL**: Why? [*puzzled*]

**BAKER**: Well... giants are dangerous.

**RAPUNZEL**: How do you know?

**BAKER**: Well, everyone knows.

**RAPUNZEL**: What about giantesses?

**BAKER**: Ah... maybe? Anyway, isn’t it better to be safe?

**RAPUNZEL**: Safe! Safe?! I’m sick and tired of people trying to keep me safe! [*shouting*]

*Suddenly the loud cries cease*.
*The Baker looks around frantically*.

**RAPUNZEL**: [*normal voice*] What are you looking for?

**BAKER**: Shush. Don’t talk. She might hear you.

**RAPUNZEL**: [*angrily*] Don’t tell me not to talk! I never get to talk.

**BAKER**: [*whisper*] Please, you can talk all you want when we get down from here. Just please, be still.

**RAPUNZEL**: [*snapping*] No! I will not be still. Some brother you are. You’re just like everyone else, trying to control me.

**BAKER**: I’m just trying to protect you.

**RAPUNZEL**: [*slaps him*] That’s what they all say.

*She turns and runs away*.
*The Giantess spies her*.

**GIANTESS**: Fee, Fie, Foe, Furl. I smell the blood of an English... girl?

*Loud footsteps ensue*.

**RAPUNZEL**: Aiieee! [*runs Left*]

**BAKER**: Aaargh! [*runs Right*]

### Scene 6: Back Down Below

**WIFE**: Are you sure this is the way to your grandmothers house?

**RED**: Of course I'm sure. In fact, there she is now. Hello Grannie!

**GRANNIE**: Hello, Red! Ready to skin another wolf? [*leering*]

**RED**: Not today, Grannie. You remember the nice Hunter...

**WIFE**: Baker!

**RED**: ... Baker who saved us from the wolf?

**GRANNIE**: Yes, of course. So nice to let us have the skin. [*cackling*]

**RED**: Well, this is his wife. He ran off into the woods, and she wants our help finding him.

**GRANNIE**: But why did he run away in the first place?

**RED**: [*loud whisper*] They had an argument!

*Grannie bolts upright, and dashes between Red and the Baker’s Wife*.

**GRANNIE**: Red! Run for your life!

**RED**: Huh? What are you scared of?

**GRANNIE**: Marriage, child. More dangerous than wolves, bears, and snakes all combined. I fear neither devil nor beast, but even I have better sense than to get caught between a man and wife when they are feuding.

**WIFE**: We aren’t “feuding”...

*Wife steps toward Red, then pulls back hurriedly when Grannie yanks out a knife and waves it threateningly!*

**GRANNIE**: Keep your evil away from my granddaughter!

**RED**: Grannie...

*Just then, the Baker rushes in. He’s about to speak to Grannie when he sees his wife and child.*

**BAKER**: You! [*stunned*]

**WIFE**: You’re safe! [*rushes into his arms*]

*For one tender moment, he gathers his wife and child to his chest.*

**WIFE**: [*muffled*] I was so worried about you.

**BAKER**: I am so sorry I scared you.

**WIFE**: Well, [*pulling back, embarrassed*] everything is fine now.

**BAKER**: Yes... no! No, there’s a giant. A.. a giantess. And she caught my sister!

**RED**: You have a sister?

**WIFE**: You found your sister?

**GRANNIE**: Where is this giant?

**BAKER**: She was on top of the beanstalk. We need to ask the Royal Family to send a rescue party.

**GRANNIE**: But why would they listen to you?

**BAKER**: Because my sister is married to the younger Prince Charming!

**WIFE**: Yes! Let's go see the Princes... I mean, rescue your sister!

### Scene 7: The Castle

*Cinderella is sitting doing embroidery.*

**STEWARD**: Your highness, a... peasant claims to have urgent news for the Royal Family.

**CINDERELLA**: Why doesn’t he take it to the King?

**STEWARD**: The King... has other matters to attend to.

**CINDERELLA**: Should we call my husband?

**STEWARD**: He... is out... hunting. I’m sure he must have sent word, but you forgot.

**CINDERELLA**: Oh... very well then, send the peasant in.

**STEWARD**: [*coughing*] There’s actually a large group of them. And some of them are rather... rough.

**CINDERELLA**: [*smiling*] I can handle a little rough. Send them all in.

**STEWARD**: If you insist. [*exits*]

**CINDERELLA**: I wonder what this could be about. I hope nothing has happened to mother’s... no, I’m just being silly.

*The Baker, with Wife and child, Grannie and Red all enter and kneel.*

**PEASANTS**: Your Highness

**CINDERELLA**: Welcome to the castle. Please speak your mind.

**STEWARD**: And be quick about it!

**BAKER**: Milady, I bring you urgent news about your sister-in-law, Princess Rapunzel.

**STEWARD**: Rapunzel!

**BAKER**: Yes. She was attacked by a giantess.

**CINDERELLA**: Was she hurt?!?

**BAKER**: [*agitated*] I.. I don’t know... I...

**WIFE**: [*taking over*] There’s no time. Someone need to go rescue her.

**STEWARD**: From where? [*suspiciously*]

**BAKER**: From the top of a beanstalk!

**STEWARD**: Beanstalks? Seriously.

**WIFE**: He speaks the truth.

**BAKER**: It’s true. I was there with her.

**STEWARD**: And why would she climb a beanstalk with you?

**BAKER**: Because I’m her brother!

**STEWARD**: This is preposterous. Your highness, this man is clearly mad. Or part of some devilish scheme to lure us away from the castle.

**WIFE**: What? Don’t you even care that a Princess is missing?

**STEWARD**: Of course we care. Why, I searched the woods myself this morning. There was no sign of any beanstalk.

**BAKER**: [*mutters*] You probably never looked up from licking the Prince’s boots.

**STEWARD**: What did you say?

**WIFE**: [*hurriedly*] He said, we are sorry for taking up both your time.

**STEWARD**: Is there nothing else?

**BAKER**: Please... just one more thing. [*taking his scarf in his hands*]

*Cinderella glances at the Steward. He sighs.*

**STEWARD**: Very well. Be quick about it.

 **BAKER**: Princess... I never had a family growing up. I only just realized I had a sister. She is... very precious to me. Please, is there anything you can do?

**CINDERELLA**: [*softly*] Maybe... maybe there is. I can make no promises, but I will try my best.

*The Baker seems about to say more, but the Steward cuts him off*.

**STEWARD**: You’ve had your say. Now leave. Shoo. Shoo!

*They all exit, leaving Cinderella by herself*.
*She sits there a moment, lost in thought*.
*Then suddenly jumps to her feet*.

**CINDERELLA**: That’s it!

*She runs excitedly off stage*.

### Scene 8: Jack's House

*Jack is sitting inside happily milking Milky White*.

**JACK**: Isn't it amazing how well he gives milk after being raised from the dead?

**JACK'S MOM**: Yes, dear, but why O why do you have to milk *her* inside the house? Why milk her at all when we can just buy milk?

**JACK**: But he enjoys it so much, doesn't he?

**JACK'S MOM**: [*sighing*] O Jack, whatever will become of you when I'm gone?

*Commotion outside. The Peasants arrive. Jack stands up to greet them warmly*.

**BAKER**: Jack, we need your help!

**JACK**: What happened?

**WIFE**: The Princess Rapunzel has been kidnapped by a giantess at the top of a new beanstalk.

**JACK**: Really?

**BAKER**: Well... [*his wife elbows him*] yes! I am sure that is exactly what happened.

**JACK**: Then we must go rescue her!

**JACK's MOM**: You’ll do nothing of the kind. You must stay here where it’s safe.

**JACK**: Mother! [*glancing at Red*] Don’t be silly. [*lowering voice*] I’m a man now.

*The Baker’s Wife and Jack’s Mother roll their eyes, but the Baker claps him on the shoulder. And Red giggles*.

**BAKER**: Good man! Let us be off.

**JACK**: Oh wait, I have an idea [*rushes into another room*]

*Jack's mom turns to the Baker's Wife*.

**JACK'S MOM**: Please, isn't there anything you can do to stop them ? He's so young.

**WIFE**: Don't worry. I promise we won't let him out our sight. He will be fine. Who knows, he might even surprise you!

**JACK'S MOM**: [*muttering*] That's what I'm afraid of.

**JACK**: [*returning*] What's that, mother?

**JACK'S MOM**: [*flustered*] I said, be sure to keep your scarf on!

**JACK**: What scarf?

**JACK'S MOM**: [*stares helplessly for a moment, then her eyes go wide*] Ah! This scarf...

*Rummages around in a chest and pulls out a scarf. Stops to regard it tenderly*.

**JACK'S MOM**: It... it was your father's, Jack. He used to wear it to cut wood. I guess... maybe you are old enough to wear it.

*She wraps it around him, kisses his cheek, then runs off to hide her tears*.

**BAKER**: Good man. [*claps Jack on the back*] Let’s be off!

*All exit.*

### Scene 9: The Woods

*Cinderella walks in disguised in her old rags, taking to her bird friends*.

**CINDERELLA**:  Oh, how fun it is to be out on my own again. [*listens to birds*] Yes, that was a brilliant idea to go visit my mother. Surely her spirit would know how to save Rapunzel from the giantess.

*Suddenly there is a loud crunching sound*.
*Cinderella starts, then hides in the bushes*.

[*The Prince Charmings come out and do their *Agony Reprise* from the original Act II, about their new loves*]

*When they leave, Cinderella comes out stunned. She looks after her prince, and seems about to to speak when the Bakers, Red and Jack rush in*.

*They stop when they see her. She hurriedly composes herself*.

**BAKER**: Miss, you shouldn’t be here. There are giants about.

**CINDERELLA**: Yes, I know [*forcing a calm*]

**BAKER**: How would you know? I only just told the Princess... O my, you are the Princess.

*They all kneel. She smiles sadly*.

**CINDERELLA**: I am not a princess here... [*softly*] if I ever really was. [*normal voice*] Please, all rise!

*They stand. Jack rushes up to her*.

**JACK**: We are going to save Rapunzel!

**CINDERELLA**: [*confused*] But you are just a boy!

**JACK**: Not anymore. I’ve already slain one giant. [*puffs out his chest*]

**WIFE**: [*to Baker*] Where is that beanstalk?

**BAKER**: I know it is here somewhere...

**RED**: There it is!

*The Baker looks at Jack. He nods*.
*The Baker turns to his Wife*.

**BAKER**: Wish me luck.

*His Wife adjusts his scarf. Then, on impulse, she takes off her shawl and places it on his shoulders*.

**BAKER**: What... what is that for?

**WIFE**: For warmth... and good luck. [*then stands on her tiptoes to give him a quick kiss*]

*Red and Jack stand awkwardly while this happens. Jack glances briefly at Red. She glares at him and he hurriedly turns away. He stares at his shoes while she stares at him. Finally she snaps*.

**RED**: Okay, fine. But this is only for warmth!

*She twirls off her wolf cloak and shoves it at him, then stomps off stage without a backward glance*.

*Jack watches her open-mouthed. Cinderella titters*.
*The Baker punches him in the arm*.

**BAKER**: Okay, son, are you ready?

**JACK**: Y... Yes, sir!

*The Baker puts his arm around Jack and leads him offstage*.

*Cinderella watches them go, smiling sadly*.
*She turns to see the Baker’s Wife staring after her husband with a strange expression*.

**CINDERELLA**: Is... everything all right?

*The Baker’s Wife jumps as if embarrassed*.

**WIFE**: Me? Oh.. nothing... it’s just.

*Cinderella sits on the log and pats the seat next to her*.
*The Baker’s Wife sits down stiffly, a little distance away*.

**WIFE**: I... I’m not sure I can explain. You... probably wouldn’t understand, being married to a Prince and all.

*Cinderella starts*.

**CINDERELLA**: That... means much less than you might think. [*her voice breaking*]

*She suddenly collapses into violent sobs. The Baker’s Wife is shocked at first , but then shifts the baby around and gathers Cinderella into her bosom, and comforts her while she weeps*.

### Scene 10: Giantess In The Sky

*The Baker and Jack creep quietly back onstage*.

*Suddenly they hear a series of shrieks*.

**JACK**: Was that the Princess? Is she alive?

**BAKER**: If so, it’s not for long. We better hurry.

*They get ready for battle*.
*The shrieks get louder, and louder*.
*Just when they are about to dash off, Rapunzel appears, shrieking... with laughter*.

**BAKER**: Rapunzel! You’re alive.

*Rapunzel stops laughing, and stares at the Baker, stunned*.
*Jack steps out from behind him*.

**JACK**: Princess! We have come to rescue you.

*Rapunzel goes wide-eyed, then collapses on the ground, laughing*.

**BAKER**: She may have gone mad. Quickly, help me carry her.

*They hurry over, but before they can pick her up she stops laughing and hisses at them*.

**RAPUNZEL**: Don’t touch me!

**BAKER**: Rapunzel, don’t you recognize me?

**RAPUNZEL**: [*glaring*] Of course I do! You’re the brother who knew who I really was, and never sought me out to tell me. And once you found me, all you wanted to do was control me and keep me safe.

*The Baker hangs his head in shame*.
*Rapunzel whirls on Jack*.

**RAPUNZEL**: And you! You are the ungrateful whelp who stole from the giantess after she took pity on you, and then slew her husband. You better get out of here. If she ever sees you again...

*She pauses dramatically, and does a Boom-Squish with her foot*.

*Jack flinches, and the Baker pulls him closer protectively*.

**BAKER**: Princess...

**RAPUNZEL**: Don’t call me that! Don’t even call me Rapunzel. That was the name the witch gave me. Better yet, don’t call me at all. Leave and never come back.

*Turns to walk away*.

**BAKER**: Please... sister. Come back home with us.

*Rapunzel turns and stalks toward him*.
*The men shrink back from her fury*.

**RAPUNZEL**: Home? I've never had a home! Just a series of prisons. This is my home. The Giantess agrees with me. All humans... all men! ... are selfish, greedy, controlling bastards.

*Rapunzel laughs. Her face is transformed into a mad sort of joy*.

**RAPUNZEL**: Here I am free! No walls. No towers. No men. We just sit and braid each other’s hair, and eat the wild berries that grow everywhere.

*Walks about, as if in a reverie*.

**RAPUNZEL**: And we talk! Do you know I have never had anyone to talk to? And she is such a wonderful listener. I can talk to her for hours, about anything and everything.

*She turns and approaches the Baker, her eyes glistening. She lays a hand on his arm. For once, her voice is actually gentle*.

**RAPUNZEL**: Please. Don’t you see? For once in my life, I am truly happy. Just leave me in peace.

**JACK**: But... shouldn’t you be around your own kind?

*Just then a voice shouts from offstage.*

**GIANTESS**: Rapunzel, where are you?

*Rapunzel draws herself up*.

**RAPUNZEL**: She is my own kind. If you know what’s good for you, you’ll leave before she finds you.

*Rapunzel turns her back on them and struts off majestically*.
*The Baker starts to lunge after her, but Jack grabs his arm*.
*The giantess’s footsteps grow louder*.
*The Baker shakes off Jack’s arm, takes one last look at the fleeing Rapunzel, then turns, grabs Jacks arm and heads back the way they came*.

*Neither notice the bag Jack had dropped, now lying abandoned on stage*.

*Ethereal music starts to play...*

### Scene 11: The Woods

*The Baker's Wife wanders in from stage left, apparently lost in thought*.
*Cinderella’s Prince strides in*.
*He stops when he sees her*.
*His lips curl into a smile reminiscent of the Wolf*.

**PRINCE**: Greetings.

**WIFE**: [*startled*] What? Oh! [*bowing*]

**PRINCE**: You shouldn’t be out and about alone. I have heard from my Steward that a giantess may have kidnapped Princess Rapunzel.

[*They start reenacting the “Moments” song from the original version, where he seduces her. But this time, she realizes how much the Prince is hurting Cinderella, and the shallowness of their attraction. She spurns him in song, and chooses Meaning over Moments*]

*The Prince looks abashed, trapped in an unaccustomed situation of self-reflection*.

**WIFE**: [*scornfully*] Was your father this callous towards your mother?

**PRINCE**: [*absently, still struggling with novel thoughts and feelings*] No, he was faithful to her while she lived. After she died and he became ill, well... it was just the way he was. So it seemed the only way for a Prince to be.

**WIFE**: [*tenderly*] I’m sorry. But maybe... you don’t have to be just a Prince?

**PRINCE**: What do you mean?

**WIFE**: Well [*chuckling*] my husband was just a Baker, but now he’s climbing a beanstalk to confront a Giant.

**PRINCE**: [*eagerly*] Really! Take me to him. I thirst for danger and excitement.

**WIFE**: [*laughing gaily*] Courageous, are you?

**PRINCE**: [*modestly*] I don’t mean to brag, but I have never shied away from a dangerous quest.

**WIFE**: [*slyly*] Have you, now? Well then, I have the perfect challenge for you...

*She leads him offstage*.

### Scene 12: Grannie's House

*Jack and the Baker finish relating their failure to Red and Grannie*.

**BAKER**: I don’t know. Maybe she’s right, and I’m being selfish to want her to leave the giant.

**GRANNIE**: Poppycock!

**JACK**: Huh?

**GRANNIE**: I said Poppycock. You men are being idiots, as usual.

**BAKER**: I beg your pardon!

**RED**:  Oh, of course!

**JACK**: Huh?

*Red punches him in the arm*.

**RED**: Don’t be dense. Rapunzel isn’t just a princess. She is also a mother. And the only thing more important to her than her own happiness...

**GRANNIE**: ... is that of her children. Exactly.

**BAKER**: Okay, fine. But are you suggesting I take her children up there?

**JACK**: That seems... dangerous.

**GRANNIE**: Idiots. Of course not. I’m just pointing out the real issue isn’t whether you are being selfish, but how to help her remember she is a mother.

**BAKER**: But... that’s impossible!

**JACK**: Maybe... maybe not! I’ve just had a wonderful idea!

**RED**: Tell us!

**JACK**: I’ll do better. I’ll show you!

*He grabs Red by the hand and runs off, with the Baker scurrying after*.
*Grannie stays behind, watching them, clicking her tongue*.

### Scene 13: Cinderella's Tree

*Cinderella is backstage facing the tree of her mother, holding the Baker's baby, talking softly*.

*The Prince and the Baker’s Wife enter from stage left*.

**PRINCE**: [*haughtily*] Are you sure this quest is worthy of me?

**WIFE**: I assure you this is the most difficult and dangerous quest ever undertaken by man. In fact, I fear you will quail and run away once I show it to you.

**PRINCE**: Don’t be ridiculous. I laugh in the face of danger.

**WIFE**: But it is agonizingly slow and difficult, with victory seeming always out of reach.

**PRINCE**: But that is the best kind of quest! Especially if there is a beautiful Princess at the end.

**WIFE**: [*smiling wickedly*] Perfect. In that case, behold your quest [*turns him around to see Cinderella, who collapses in a storm of weeping*]

**PRINCE**: But... that’s my... she... why.. [*turns to look at the Baker’s Wife helplessly*]

**WIFE**: [*scornfully*] Any boy can win the heart of an innocent maiden with fancy balls and charming words. It takes a real man to woo a woman whose heart has been broken by betrayal and grief. It takes risk, vulnerability, and courage beyond anything you ever imagined. It requires months and years of endless introspection and sacrifice, with no guarantee of success.

**PRINCE**: But that’s... impossible! Unfair!

**WIFE**: [*laughing gaily*] Of course it is!

**PRINCE**: You tricked me! This is a... bait and switch!

**WIFE**: [*savagely*]. Exactly! Just like you tricked us. Promising us sweetness and joy, concealing the fact it was all a deception merely to feed your ego.

**PRINCE**: This is a travesty. Your quest is a lie.

**WIFE**: [*shouting*] And so are you!

*The Prince stumbles back, stunned by her vehemence*.
*The Baker’s Wife turns away*.

**WIFE**: [*mostly to herself*] When I was a little girl, I dreamed of marrying a prince. Even after my father married me off to the young baker who came to his mill, I continued to cherish fantasies of riding away with a handsome Prince on his white horse.

*The Prince takes a half-step towards her*.

**WIFE**: [*whirling*] You destroyed my dreams. And I thank you for it, because now I know what kind of man I really want. But you also destroyed hers, who never did you any harm. So in exchange, I have destroyed yours. From now on. Any time you seduce maiden. Any time you claim to stalk a giant. You. Will. Have. To. Remember!

*She walks up and pokes him in the chest*.

**WIFE**: [*whispering*] You are only doing it because you are afraid of the real thing.

*The Baker’s Wife stalks offstage*.

*The Prince stands there, trembling*.
*He closes his eyes*.

**PRINCE**: I think... I already knew.

*He turns and looks at Cinderella weeping*.
*He stumbles toward her, pulled against his will, as if by gravity*.

*Cinderella’s sobs have subsided*.
*She seems to hear him*.
*She half-rises and turns*.

*The Prince cries out, and dashes away in the opposite direction*.

*Cinderella stands and looks about thoughtfully, wondering if she actually saw and heard what she thought she did*.
*Then a thought strikes her, and she gathers her skirts and runs off*.

### Scene 14: The Witch's House

*Gothel the Witch sits outside her house next to the Baker's*.
*She wistfully strokes the hair she cut off from Rapunzel before casting her into the desert, humming snatches of Rapunzel’s song*.
*She hears Jack shouting, and hurriedly tries to hide the hair behind her*.

*Jack and Red rush in, then stop abruptly at the sight of the Witch*.
*She tries to put on an intimidating face, but doesn’t quite succeed*.
*She is about to speak when Jack interrupts*.

**JACK**: Ma’am, we have news of your daughter!

*The Witch's facade breaks, and she is suddenly vulnerable.*

**WITCH**: Rapunzel? Where is she? Is she in danger? [*half-afraid, half eagerly*]

**JACK**: Um, well...

**RED**: [*interrupting*] She ran away from the castle, climbed a beanstalk, made friends with a giantess, and refuses to come down because she’s forgotten about her children.

**WITCH**: [*impressed*] My, that was concise.

*The Baker finally stumbles in, out of breath*.
*The Witch’s eyes narrow*.
*She turns to Jack*.

**WITCH**: [*pointing at the Baker*] HE didn’t send you, did he?

**JACK**: [*affronted*] Nobody sent me. This was my plan. [*lowers voice*] I am a man now.

*Red rolls her eyes*.
*But the Witch is intrigued*.

**WITCH**: Do you... have a plan to restore my daughter to me?

**JACK**: Um, no.

**WITCH**: [*angrily*] Then why did you even come here!

**JACK**: [*gently*] Because you are her mother. And you love her. And she needs your help. Isn’t that reason enough?

**WITCH**: [*holding back tears*] She... doesn’t want my help. She... she hates me.

**BAKER**: No [*with solemn finality*]

*All eyes stop and turn to him*.
*Nobody see the Baker’s Wife enter from the side, watching him*.

*The Baker walks gingerly towards the Witch*.

**BAKER**: I know what it feels like to be angry at a parent you feel has betrayed you. And yes, there were times that I hated him. But that was precisely because I needed him so much. And I didn’t want to need his help, because I was afraid he’d let me down again.

*He looks up, and sees his Wife*.
*She runs to him*.
*He puts an arm around her, and turns back to the witch*.

**BAKER**: And in the end, when I needed him most, he came through and helped me... us... complete the spell, and gain a child. Even if it killed him [*sadly*]

*He looks up again, and sees the Mysterious Stranger at the edge of the stage*.

**BAKER**: I still didn’t forgive him. I couldn’t understand why he would run out on me like that. Until...

*Looks down at his wife*.
*She squeezes his shoulder*.
*He looks at her and smiles sadly*.

**BAKER**: Until I realized I did the very same thing.

[*Sings a version of You Are Not Alone*]

**BAKER**: [*To the Witch*] It’s not your fault. You did the best you could with what you knew. The reason it all went wrong is because you tried to do it all by yourself. But you aren’t alone any more.

*The Witch turns away*.
*But then Rapunzel’s Prince appears, carrying their babies*.
*The Witch stares in shock, then collapses into tears when her grandchildren are placed in her arms*.

*Cinderella follows him onstage, and returns the Baker’s baby to his parents*.

*There is a long silence*.
*Then the Witch dries her tears, stands up, hands the babies back to the Prince, and looks straight at the Baker*.

**WITCH**: I am ready. I don’t care if she hates me enough to never speak to me again. Tell me what I must do to reunite my daughter with her babies, so she can have her happily ever after.

*The Baker looks stunned*.

**BAKER**: Ah. Well, I, I... was thinking...

*His Wife squeezes his hand*.
*He turns and looks at her for a long moment*.

**BAKER**: I mean, WE were thinking, now that everyone’s here, we could all put our head’s together and come up with a plan.

**JACK**: Let’s do it at my house! We just built a new barn so Milky White could have plenty of friends, and there’s lots of room for everyone.

*They hurry offstage*.
*The Witch follows slowly*.
*At the edge, she pauses.*  
*She turns back, and sees the Mysterious Stranger enter.*  
*He bows low, respectfully.*  
*She smiles, nods, and blows him a kiss.*  
*He straightens, nods, and salutes with a fist to his chest.*

**WITCH**: You should be proud. You have an amazing son.

**MYSTERIOUS STRANGER**: [*bitterly*] No thanks to me.

**WITCH**: [*harshly*] Don’t say that!

*He jumps*.

**WITCH**: I’m sorry. But... I have to believe. You... you came back. You... tried to undo... everything that went wrong. It wasn’t enough for him to forgive you. Yet somehow... he found his own way. I have to believe... I wish... [*she cries and runs away*]

*The Mysterious Stranger watches her, until the light goes out*.

## HALFTIME

### Scene 15: Rapunzel In The Sky

*Rapunzel is walking along, happily singing her song.*  
*Suddenly she stops.*  
*But her song does not.*

*It continues on.*  
*Not merely an echo.*  
*But actually richer and more elaborate.*

**RAPUNZEL**: What... where?

*She wanders about trying to find the source of the music and stumbles across Jack’s bag*.

*Suddenly, the music stops*.
*She picks up the bag and stares at it suspiciously*.
*Finally, she screws up her courage and thrusts her arm into it, pulling out*...

**RAPUNZEL**: A Harp!

*The Harp responds by playing the enhanced version of Rapunzel’s song*.

**RAPUNZEL**: That is so beautiful! Did you just improvise that?

**HARP**: No, that’s the original version.

*Rapunzel is so shocked she drops the harp*.

**RAPUNZEL**: You can talk?!

**HARP**: Well, it does get tiring to sing all the time.

**RAPUNZEL**: But... you’re a person? Where did you come from? How did you get here?

**HARP**: I should ask you the same question! I’m sure I’ve been up here longer than you’ve been alive. For that matter, how do you know my song?

**RAPUNZEL**: Your song? My mo... I mean, the witch who stole me from my parents taught it to me.

**HARP**: Did you say... a witch?

*The Harp makes a sharp keening sound, indescribably sad and heartbreaking*.

**RAPUNZEL**: Are you... okay?

**HARP**: I... tell me, does this witch live in a beautiful garden?

**RAPUNZEL**: How would I know? She locked me in a tower my whole life. I never saw anyone but her until I was eighteen. And when I finally met someone, she got rid of him to ensure I would never have anyone to love me. She is the worst mother ever!

*Harp spills out a series of notes, like rain weeping*.

**HARP**: [*quietly*] No. No, she is not... I was.

*And then Harp begins sobbing. Great, anguished, human cries of grief*.

### Scene 16: The King's Bedroom

*The King is lying in bed*.
*Feminine giggles sound from offstage*.

**KING**: Farewell, my dears!

*He leans back, looking pleased with himself*.
*Suddenly the room darkens, and ominous music plays*.
*He sits up, nervous*.
*The Witch enters*.

**WITCH**: So... this is why you broke our engagement? So you could play patty-cake with the palace maids?

**KING**: You! Gothel! Here!

*She stalks towards him with undisguised malice*.
*The King flinches, but from somewhere finds the strength to sit up straight in bed. He looks almost... regal*.

**KING**: Yes... I suppose it is finally time I paid my debt. But before you do your worst [*looks sharply at her*] I have something must say to you.

*The Witch pauses, anger warring with curiosity, and the briefest hint of vulnerability. The King draws a deep breath, then lets it out*.

**KING**: [*whispering*] I’m sorry.

*The words strike the Witch like a lightnight bolt. He doesn’t notice*.

**KING**: [*stronger, and more agitated*] I’m sorry I left you at the altar. I’m sorry I didn’t have the courage to run away with you. I’m sorry I was too ashamed to even send a message explaining how my father had forced me into a marriage I didn’t want. [*Looks up*] But I’m not sorry that I get to see your face one last time before I die. It is a far greater kindness than I deserve.

*The Witch staggers back as if punched in the gut. The King finally noticed her suffering, and something comes over him*.

**KING**: Gothel! Dear, sweet Gothel are you okay? [*He strives to rise, but some invisible force seems to tie him to the bed*]

**WITCH**: No! Don’t call me that name anymore. That woman is dead. She died the day you abandoned me on my sixteenth birthday. My mother was right. All humans, all men are liars and scoundrels. I should have listened to her and never opened my heart to the human world.

*The King looks stricken. A wild sort of glee steals over his face*.

**KING**: Fine! Then kill me and be done with it. God knows I deserve it for the way I left you to suffer alone all these years. Slay me now, and end both our suffering.

*The Witch snatches a dagger from her belt and stands over the immobile king. The King sighs and lays back down. He pulls apart his shirt, exposing his chest to the naked blade*.

**KING**: [*looking up into her eyes*] Take my heart. It has always been yours. I should have given it to you long ago.

*The Witch stares at him, lifts the dagger high, then plunges it down... into the bedding, a hairs-breadth from the King*.
*She collapses on top of him, weeping. The King murmurs her name softly as he strokes her hair comfortingly*.

### Scene 17: Back In The Land Above

*Rapunzel is cradling the harp*.

**RAPUNZEL**: Wait, let me make sure I got this straight. You kept my moth.. the Witch locked up her whole life, like she did me?

**HARP**: [*sniffling*] Yes.

**RAPUNZEL**: And when she fell in love, you told the boy’s father the King to break it off, then convinced her the boy had been lying to her the whole time.

**HARP**: [*sadly*] Yes.

**RAPUNZEL**: [*sharp breath*] And that Prince... is the current King? My father-in-law?

**HARP**: You married the King’s son?

**RAPUNZEL**: [*bitterly*] If you call that marriage. Maybe you were right to break your daughter’s engagement. His whole family is full of charm and deceit. She’s probably better off alone.

*Harp strums a plaintive melody*.

**RAPUNZEL**: What does that mean?

**HARP**: It means... I’m sorry. Not only did I break her engagement, I left her in anger when she broke the pact preventing her from using magic against the kingdom. I thought I could come back after she learned her lesson, but instead I became trapped in the form of a harp. She was alone. Alone, for so long, all by herself. She must have become desperate. Desperate for a family. Someone to love. Someone to love her. Someone like...

**RAPUNZEL**: Me? [*jumping up and dumping the harp on the ground*] She stole me because you left her?

**HARP**: No. Yes. Maybe. Probably. I don’t know. I am so, so sorry.

**RAPUNZEL**: Sorry! Sorry doesn’t even begin to describe it. You’re just as evil and controlling as she is. Maybe worse.

**HARP**: I know. I am sorry. This is all my fault. Please, let me make it up to you.

**RAPUNZEL**: Ha! Are you powerful enough to turn back time and give me my mother and my childhood back?

**HARP**: [*quietly*] No.

**RAPUNZEL**: So my life is ruined. And it is all your fault. You and your daughter’s.

**HARP**: Yes [*plays a lamenting tune*]

**RAPUNZEL**: Then... I have nothing more to say to you. Goodbye. [*stomps off*]

*The Harp lying on the floor echoes her footsteps until she is offstage*.

**HARP**: Goodbye... my precious granddaughter.

[*Plays a dirge-like version of Rapunzel’s theme*]

### Scene 18: Back in The King's Bedroom

*The Witch has cried herself out, and sits up next to the King*.

**WITCH**: I... didn’t actually come here to kill you.

*The King smiles and squeezes her hand*.

**KING**: I don't know whether to be relieved or disappointed. Either way, I'm glad you came.

*The Witch gives a small smile*.

**WITCH**: Me too. I... [*looks down*] I need your help. I assumed I’d have to threaten you, Make you fear me with a fear worse than death.

*The King cups her chin in his hand*.

**KING**: No threats necessary. Ask anything you want, up to half my kingdom. If it is in my power, I will grant it.

**WITCH**: [*deep breath*] Actually... half your kingdom is what I wanted to ask you for.

*The King pales, but manages to regain his composure*.

**KING**: That... isn’t exactly what I expected. [*sees her expression darkening*] But, a promise is a promise. I will do what I can. However... [*looking down*] might I at least ask what you will do with the land... and the people?

*The Witch shakes her head*.

**WITCH**: It isn’t for me. It is to save my daughter... your daughter-in-law. Rapunzel.

*The King has a shocked look. The Witch actually laughs*.

**WITCH**: Not that kind of daughter. I... [*blushes*] never married. She’s adopted. I [*chokes up*] thought I... could keep her to myself. [*weeps*].

*The King takes her hand*.

**KING**: What... do you need from me?

*The Witch flashes him a grateful look*.

**WITCH**: She is hiding in the land of giants. She has befriended a giantess. I was hoping [*takes the King’s hand*] we could grant them a parcel of land here down below. Setup a... trading post, with The Land Above. The existing humans could stay, but as tenants under Giant Law.

*The King stiffens*.
*The Witch pulls her hand back*.
*She looks at him*.

**WITCH**: [*in a small voice*] Is that... too much to ask?

*The King pats her hand and smiles*.

**KING**: No, my dear. If anything, it is a most generous offer. Trade with The Land Above would make me the envy of the Seven Kingdoms. [*growing sober*] My concern is for what happens next. Humans and Giants... have never lived together in peace. And as much as it pains me to say it, the fault is usually on our side. But if a Giant kills a human, even in self-defense...

*The Witch gets up and stomps around the room*.

**WITCH**: Aargh! Why do you humans have to be so difficult?

*The King chuckles*.

**KING**: It is part of our charm. But... if you’ll forgive my asking [*coughs*] can’t you just [*waves his hand in a magical sort of way*]

*The Witch’s smile is bittersweet*.

**WITCH**: That's... another story. Suffice to say that disobeying my mother carried a heavy price, and paying that price cost me my magic.

*The King looks crestfallen*.
*But he quickly hides it*.

**KING**: That... is only to be expected. Still, we must make the best of it. What must I do?

**WITCH**: I need you to issue a Royal Decree dedicating all the land on that side of the woods as an enclave for the giants. And I’ll need someone of stature to enforce it.

**KING**: I will send my son and his steward. My son... well, he means well, but it is safer to send the steward as well.

**WITCH**: Very well. [*looks him in the eye and curtsy’s*] Thank you, your majesty.

*The King stares at her, until she turns away*.

**KING**: Will I... see you again?

*The Witch slowly walks away, eyes downcast*.

**WITCH**: I... can promise nothing. You are not the only one to whom I owe a debt. My life... is no longer my own.

**KING**: Then, fare thee well, sweet Gothel. [*blows her a kiss*]

*The Witch exits*.

### Scene 19: Back Above

*Cinderella enters from stage right, accompanied by birds*.

**CINDERELLA**: Fly ahead, my friend. Search high and low until you find my sister-in-law Rapunzel.

*They fly away while Cinderella wanders about. Suddenly she spies the harp, and walks over to it*.

**CINDERELLA**: How odd? Who would leave such a valuable harp just lying around? [*picks it up*]

**HARP**: [*bitterly*] Leave me be!

**CINDERELLA**: You talk?

**HARP**: *I* talk? You talk to birds, and you’re surprised by a talking harp?

**CINDERELLA**: Never mind that. Can you tell me where I can find the Princess Rapunzel?

**HARP**: [*sighing*] As far away from me as she can get. Why do you want her?

**CINDERELLA**: We are trying to reunite her with her children.

**HARP**: Her... she has... my great-grandchildren!

**CINDERELLA**: What?

**HARP**: Never mind. Do you have a plan?

**CINDERELLA**: Yes. Well, actually the Witch is doing most of the work.

**HARP**: No! She will just try to trap Rapunzel again.

*Cinderella shakes her head*.

**CINDERELLA**: No, it isn’t like that. She realizes she was wrong. She will do anything to save Rapunzel, no matter what it costs her.

*The Harp plays a series of agitated notes*.

**HARP**: Are... are you sure? Do you know what she intends?

*Cinderella shrugs*.

**CINDERELLA**: Not entirely. She said some sort of pact with the Land Above.

**HARP**: No!

**CINDERELLA**: What do you mean, no?

**HARP**: No time to explain. You... you must take me to her. [*long pause*] Please?

*Cinderella looks around unsure, then finally makes a decision*.

**CINDERELLA**: Okay, fine. But I hope you know what you’re doing. The Witch... isn’t very patient with those who disappoint her.

**HARP**: [*under her breath*] Like mother like daughter.

**CINDERELLA**: What?

**HARP**: I said, we oughter get going. Time is of the essence!

*Cinderella picks her up and hurries offstage*.

### Scene 20: Grannie's House

*Jack and Red and sitting with Grannie and the Bakers. The Witch enters*.

**JACK**: Did he agree?

**GRANNIE**: [*eagerly*] Did he beg for mercy?

*The Witch dabs at her eyes*.

**WITCH**: He was... wonderful. But [*recovering*] yes, he agreed. He will send the Prince -- and more importantly, the Steward -- to witness the deed.

**WIFE**: [*takes the Baker’s hand,looks at the Witch*] Are you sure this is safe?

**WITCH**: [*forcing a smile*] Of course it will be safe [*under her breath*] for you.

**BAKER**: What do you need us to do?

**WITCH**: [*looking at Jack*] Take them all to the site of the giant’s grave. Ask your mother to gather all your neighbors at midnight. Tell them the King has an important announcement and that they must attend.

**WIFE**: Where will *you* be?

**WITCH**: I have... some unfinished business to take care of. [*exits*]

### Scene 21: Cinderella's Grove

*The Witch walks gingerly up to the tree*.

**WITCH**: [*quietly*] Hello, sister. [*waits for a long moment, then sighs*] I know you hate me, and you have every right to. I won’t bother to ask your forgiveness, and no apology could make up for the curse that sundered you from your husband and daughter. [*steps closer*] But... perhaps I can offer you something better.

[*the Witch walks over and places her hand on the trunk*]

**WITCH**: [*whispering*] Revenge.

[*The tree twitches as if interested. What might be a face appears briefly*]

**WITCH**: [*taking a deep breath*] As you know, it is not easy to kill a witch. But I’ve heard it said that the dryads can grow a thorn that will drain all the life and magic from a witch. [*steps back and looks the tree in the face*] If you give me one, I promise I will put it to good use. And I will never trouble you -- or anyone else -- ever again.

[*Long silence. Then a bird flies in and drops a thorny branch on the ground. The Witch looks at it for a few moments, hesitates, then pulls out the Baker’s scarf and uses that to pick it up. She turns to walk away, but stops after a few steps. She pivots to face the tree*.]

**WITCH**: [*bowing low. Stands up. Chokes out:*] I... I’m so, so so sorry. [*then turns and dashes away*]

### Scene 22: The Giant's Grave

*It is the last midnight. All the peasants are gathered around Milky White and Jack's Mother, muttering impatiently. Cinderella's Prince and the Steward enter. The Steward hands the Prince a scroll*.

**PRINCE**: [*reading; bored yet pompous*] “By decree of the King, and to right an ancient wrong, this land is immediately and henceforth forevermore... [*pauses in shock*] ceded to the Giants from the Land Above?! And... all inhabitants must either leave, or voluntarily submit to Giant Law!!!?!”

*The peasants erupt in bedlam. The Prince turns to the Steward*.

**PRINCE**: This is madness. Did you know about this? [*The Steward shrugs*] But this doesn’t make any sense? There aren’t any giants here. There aren’t even any beanstalks!

**WITCH**: Not yet!

*All heads turn to see the Witch entering, bearing a thorny branch.*

**PRINCE**:  [*blustering*] You cannot be serious.

*The Witch looks at him, not just with contempt, but a tinge of sadness*.

**WITCH**: Deadly serious.

*She pulls out the branch and gazes up into the sky*.

**WITCH**: I am sorry, mother. You were right. Mortals and magic were never meant to mix. This land must be returned to the wild. What went wrong must be made right. [*lifts the thorn into the moonlight*] Accept my sacrifice, and restore this giant back to life, so that my daughter may return to her life. [*prepares to plunge it into her heart*]

**CINDERELLA**: [*entering*] No!

*Everyone freezes. Rapunzel’s song starts playing on the harp*.

**JACK**: My harp!

**WITCH**: [*stunned*] That... song. It’s... not quite the one I taught Rapunzel...

*Cinderella walks slowly up to the Witch, and gravely hands her the harp. The music stops*.

**WITCH**: Who... how... do you know that song?

**HARP**: [*softly*] I wrote it... for you.

**WITCH**: [*dropping the harp, stepping back*] M... Mo... Mother?!

*The Harp riffs on Rapunzel’s motif to create a song of sadness, regret, and longing*.

*When she finishes, there is a moment of silence*.

**HARP**: I will not ask you for forgiveness. But I will ask you this: Don’t do it. Don’t throw your life away. Don’t... sacrifice yourself to raise this giant from the dead.

**WITCH**: What, so I can become like you? Ascend to a higher plane, a lifeless object who cares only about her own music? No, Mother. I was you once. No more. I finally found something worth living for. Worth dying for. Something you could never understand.

[*She pulls out the beans*]

**WITCH**: These beans, when watered by my blood, will raise the giant back to life. The giantess can come live with him here, and Rapunzel will join them. And... [*voice breaking*] my grandchildren will join her. It [*looking sadly at the harp*] it is all the magic I have left.

**HARP**: No! [*violently. Everyone jumps, shocked. She continues quietly.*]. You have me. I... I can raise the giant. Please... please don’t kill your self.

**WITCH**: No! I’d rather die than live with again as your captive. [*raises the thorn*]

[*The harp laughs bitterly.*]

**HARP**: That won’t be a problem. Let me do this... and I promise you will never see me again.

**WITCH**: [*snarling*] And why should I believe you?

**HARP**: [*proudly*] Because you will kill me with your own hands!

[*There is a stunned silence as everyone absorbs this. The Witch’s expression is indecipherable*]

**CINDERELLA**: No!

*The Harp lets out a long wail*.

**HARP**: Please. You... of all people... should know I deserve this. For I was the one who -- out of jealousy -- killed your mother.

*Cinderella starts in horror, and begins to violently tremble*.

*Suddenly Cinderella’s Prince appears with a sword. He has a wild uncertain look on his face as he approaches the Harp*.

**PRINCE**: [*savagely*] Then forget the Giant! Bring my wife’s mother back from the dead!

*Everyone gasps. Cinderella looks at her Prince as if she’s never seen him before*.

*The Harp chimes gently*.

**HARP**: I'm... sorry. Her death was too long ago. Even my life isn't enough to bring her back.

**PRINCE**: [*despairingly*] Then take mine!

*He holds the sword out, point against his own breast. The crowd gasps. He is weeping. Cinderella is open-mouthed in astonishment*.

*The Prince falls to his knees before the Harp -- but does not let go of the sword*.

**PRINCE**: Please. My wife... she deserves someone to love her. To truly value her for who she is, not what she does for others. The way I never did. Or ever could.

**CINDERELLA**: No!

*Everyone turns, and is startled to see it was Cinderella who spoke. Perhaps she is too, but she rallies quickly. She walks over and plucks the sword from his suddenly nerveless fingers, and tosses it away.*

*He stares at her with wild eyes.*
*She bends down next to him and takes his hands.*

**CINDERELLA**: [*softly*] You hurt me deeply. [*he flinches away, but she doesn't let go*] But... it wasn't all your fault. I... [*pauses*] never considered the pressures of being a Prince. I too [*swallowing*] only worried about whether you loved me, not... what it meant... to love you. [*deep breath*]. Perhaps... [*smiling*] we can learn together?

*The Prince looks at her as if he had never seen her before, with eyes shining. He tries to speak, but cannot. He lowers his eyes and grips her hands tightly, pulling her closer*.

*She leans forward and kissing him on the forehead. He breaks down and collapses into her arms, sobbing. She murmurs to him soothingly*.

**HARP**: Quickly! The time is short. This is the last midnight. You must... unstring me.

**WITCH**: Mother... I... I...

*The Harp plays a heartbreakingly beautiful arpeggio*.

**HARP**: Hush. You don’t need to say anything. I have said it all to myself many times. I purchased this life at a terrible price, and it is the kindest thing you can do is let me undo it.

*The Witch, seized with a sudden fury, runs at her with the Prince’s dropped sword*.

**HARP**: [*softly*] Goodbye, my love

*At the last second, the Witch drops the sword and falls to the ground weeping*.

**WITCH**: I... I can’t. I so want to hate you. But then I realize... I became you. To love... and to let go... it never gets easier, does it?

**HARP**: [*tenderly*] No... it does not.

**WITCH**: [*picking up the sword again*] Much easier, I think... just to die. [*raises the sword and starts jabbing it into her own breast again*]

**RAPUNZEL**: No!

*Everyone starts in shock. The Witch shrieks as the sword pierces her and she falls. Rapunzel runs in and kneels at her side. Hurriedly she takes a lock of hair from her pocket and stuffs it in the Witch’s wound*.

**WITCH**: You... came back?

*Rapunzel sniffles*.

**RAPUNZEL**: [*shyly*] I heard the whole thing. I thought motherhood was all about control and self-protection, and wanted no part of it. But then I saw you... and grandmother... and I realized...

*Just then Rapunzel's Prince enters from the other side carrying their twins*.

*With a cry Rapunzel jumps up and gathers her babies to her. Her Prince stands back, shyly, unsure of his welcome. She smiles, adjusts the babies, and mouths "Thank you." He kneels before her*.

**RAPUNZEL'S PRINCE**: I know I was a better lover than a husband. But these last few days [*glances at the Baker*] I think I've finally learned what it means to be a father. I would like to... try again. If [*looking down*] you will have me.

*Rapunzel looks at him for a long moment. Then leans over and kisses him on the top of his head. He looks up, startled and grinning foolishly. She holds out a hand and helps him up. And keeps holding on as she hands him one of the babies*.

*The Baker’s Wife enters and nods approvingly at Rapunzel, and respectfully to the Witch. The Baker walks up to stand beside her*.

**BAKER**: So... what happens to the Giant?

**RAPUNZEL**: [*sighing*] I think we should let him rest in peace.

**WIFE**: What about the giantess?

**RAPUNZEL**: [*frowns*] I think she's ready to let him go. [*eyes narrowing*] But she's still my best friend! I'm not leaving her. I am NOT going back to the castle to be locked up again.

**RAPUNZEL'S PRINCE**: Then neither am I!

**CINDERELLA'S PRINCE**: Neither are we! [*Cinderella starts. He smiles*] We can build our house -- our family -- around your mother's tree, so you can see her whenever you want.

*Cinderella stares at him*.

**CINDERELLA**: Are you... sure?

**PRINCE**: [*firmly*] More sure than I’ve ever been of anything in my life.

**STEWARD**: [*spluttering*] But... you can't both leave. Who would rule the kingdom?

*The two Princes look at each other. Cinderella's Prince winks. Rapunzel's Prince grins and walks over to the Steward, and hands him a crown*.

**RAPUNZEL'S PRINCE**: I think we all know who's really been running the kingdom all these years. I think it is high time you finally get the honor to go with the responsibility.

**STEWARD**: [*stunned*] But... the King...

**WITCH**: [*smiling saucily*] I’m sure he will be fine with it. [*eyes glinting*] one way or another.

**JACK**: Wonderful! Does that mean everyone will live happily ever after?

**BAKER**: No!

*Everyone stares at him in shock.*

**BAKER**: [*embarrassed*] I mean... let’s be reasonable. This area is now outside the Kingdom, right in the middle of the woods. All you have are two Princes with no kingdom, two witches without powers, and no ruler to organize everything. How will you work together enough to survive?

*Shockingly, nobody seems upset. Just... thoughtful. Then one by one, they turn to look at the Baker*.

**BAKER**: Why... why are you staring at me like that?

**RED**: [*slowly*] So, you say we need a way to deal with wolves and other threats.

**BAKER**: Exactly!

**WIFE**: ... and negotiate deals with witches and giants.

**BAKER**: Of course!

**CINDERELLA**: And stand up to royalty, to ensure our needs and heard and respected.

**BAKER**: Now you get it.

*Everyone starts looking at each other. Mrs. Baker starts smiling*.

**BAKER**: [*started*] Wait. Why are you so happy all of a sudden?

**WIFE**: So... so you are saying we need a system... or a person... that can bring us together, to deal with all these challenges...

**BAKER**: [*nervously, unsure where this is going*] Uh, yes.

**GRANNIE**: Someone brave.

**RAPUNZEL**: Kind.

**JACK**: Generous.

**CINDERELLA'S PRINCE**: Trustworthy.

*One by one, they all start smiling at Baker*.

**BAKER**: why... why are you looking at me like that.

**WITCH**: I hereby nominate the Baker as Mayor of Giantland!

*Everyone cheers, except Baker*.

**BAKER**: [*crying*] What? You are all crazy. I am... [*downcast*] a failure. I'm a terrible husband, a worse father, a coward and a liar.

**HARP**: We know. And we know... we are no better than you.

**WITCH**: But you... [*deep breath*] have the courage to admit it.

**WIFE**: And transcend it.

**JACK**: And inspire the rest of us to do better.

 **BAKER**: But don’t you see? I couldn’t have done any of that without all of you.

*The Baker’s Wife walks over to give him a big kiss, then hugs him close*.

**WIFE**: And you don't have to!

**BAKER**: What?

**STEWARD**: A Council!

**RAPUNZEL'S PRINCE**: Of course! Like in days of old, where each tribe had someone to represent their interests before the King.

**BAKER**: But I’m no King!

**RED**: No, silly you're a Mayor. So this would be the Mayor's Council. Let's see. Rapunzel can represent the Giantess, one the Princes can represent the Kingdom, the Witch, well, Witches; and Jack's mother the villagers!

**CINDERELLA'S PRINCE**: Women on a Council? [*steely glares from Cinderella et al*] What a.. wonderful idea [*weakly*]

**BAKER**: But... I’ ve always been a Baker. That’s who I am. I don’t know how to be anything else. I don’t even know my real name. After my parents died... or whatever... they just called me Baker after my father. I don’t think I can be anything else.

[*Long pause*]

**MYSTERIOUS STRANGER**: Yes. Yes, you can.

[*Everyone turns to him as Baker’s father enters. Except Rapunzel, who turns away. He pauses, and walks up to stand behind her.*]

**MYSTERIOUS STRANGER**: [*quietly*] What I did to lose you... was unthinkable. And unforgivable.

**RAPUNZEL**: [*whirling*] I don’t care about that. How come you never came to see me? How come you only appeared to HIM! [*angrily pointing to Baker*]
Was it because [*broken*] you... you never considered me your daughter? [*starts weeping*]

**MYSTERIOUS STRANGER**: [*gathers her in his arms. She stiffens, then collapses as he strokes her hair*] Oh, my precious child. It was never about you. I was too ashamed of myself, and seeing you only reminded me of the horrible, foolish things I had done. [*looks over at Baker*] I only sought him out to manipulate him into trying to fix my mistakes [*laughing bitterly*] I was merely too weak to do the same to you.

[*There is a long silence. Then he straightens*]

**MYSTERIOUS STRANGER**: No more! My time grows short. There is one task left undone that still binds me to earth. Come! [*he takes her hand and leads her to Baker, joining their hands, then steps back*]

**MYSTERIOUS STRANGER**: [*looks at Rapunel*] You never knew your name. [*looks at Baker*] You don’t remember yours. [*sadly*] How can you move forward if you never knew who you were. [*standing up straight*]

**MYSTERIOUS STRANGER**: [*Looking at Baker*] Your true name is Marshall -- after your mother’s grandfather, a mighty soldier -- because you were destined to be a leader of men.

[*Baker steps back in awe. Standing tall, even regal. The villagers notice the transformation. Some even gasp.*]

**MYSTERIOUS STRANGER**: [*turning to Rapunzel*] And you... [*voice breaking*] we never dared speak it aloud... but just between the two of us... in whispers... [*weakening*]... we called you Grace!

[*There is a flash of blinding light... and when they look again... he is gone*]

**RAPUNZEL**: Father! [*searching wildly*]

[*Baker runs over to her and takes her hand*]

**BAKER**: It’s okay... Grace. He finished his work. He is at peace.

*Rapunzel... relaxes. The anger and pain that had stiffened her seems to flow out of her body*.

*Harp starts to sing Rapunzel’s song, but modulated, turning it into a lament. The Witch joins her in song, and walks over to pick up the harp. Which gasps in joy, but continues the song*.

*Rapunzel looks at Baker, who smiles and nods. She takes a deep breath and starts singing with them... and slowly walks over and stands by the witches. Not touching them, but singing her heart out in shared grief and loss*.

*The villagers gather around Marshall, watching the witches in wonder*.

**WIFE**: [*leans over and whispers in his ear, under the music*] I love you, Marshall.

*He blushes furiously. The villagers laugh as the witch music fades. His wife motions him forward. He climbs onto a tree stump and faces them*.

*He looks over the many faces. Friends, enemies, family. He tries to speak... but cannot*.

**JACK**: [*sings softly, then stronger*] Into the Woods, you had to go, to show us all the way to grow

**RED**: Into the woods, though out of breath, to save us all from life and death.

**WIFE**: The way was dark. We feared the cost.

**RAPUNZEL**: But now we’ve regained what was lost.

**RAPUNZEL's PRINCE**: Who needs a crown?

**CINDERELLA**: Or gorgeous gown?

**ALL**: As long as love rules in our town.

**BAKER**: Your Marshall I'll be.

**CINDERELLA'S PRINCE**:  [*to Cinderella*] I'll honor her tree.

**WITCH**: [*to Harp*] And stop avoiding family.

**ALL**: For...
*Into the Woods we now will live*  
*To own the land the King did give*  
*Over the Woods and down below*  
*To live the names we now can know*

*Into the Woods*  
*Over the Woods*

*Into the Woods and Over the Woods...*

*And Happy Ever After!*

**CINDERELLA**: I know!
