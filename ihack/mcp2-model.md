# MCP 2.0: Fractal Collaboration Model

## Core Pattern

All AI orchestration is collaborative dialogue:

```
A: B, can you help me with X?
B: Sure, but what do you mean by Y?
A: Let me clarify... or ask C
C: I can help, but need context about Z...
```

Same pattern at every scale.

## Key Primitives

**Basic Exchange:**
- ASK(question, context)
- CLARIFY(what_I_need)
- PROVIDE(answer, confidence)

**Participants:**
- Fluid roles (any can ask/answer)
- Specialized by capability
- No hierarchy

**Adaptive Context:**
- Incremental sharing
- Ask for clarification
- No context dumps

## Fractal Properties

**Self-similarity:** Same pattern for model↔tool, agent↔agent, user↔system

**Emergent complexity:** Multi-step reasoning through chained clarifications

**Natural decomposition:** "Plan trip" → "What's budget?" → "Check account"

## vs. Current Approaches

**Traditional:** Router→Memory→Tool→Policy (separate systems)

**MCP 2.0:** Participants asking participants (one pattern)

## Research Questions

1. How to prevent infinite clarification loops?
2. Optimal context sharing strategies?
3. Computational cost vs. fixed pipelines?
