# MCP 2.0: Model Context is All You Need to Protocol

## Abstract

Dominant orchestration approaches for AI systems today rely on complex chains of specialized components: prompt routers, memory stores, and tool coordinators operating in sequence with ad-hoc state management. In this work, we propose that the Model Context Protocol alone is sufficient for sophisticated AI orchestration, dispensing with these recurrent framework patterns entirely. Our approach, MCP 2.0, promises to achieve state-of-the-art unification in multi-agent workflows while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less engineering overhead. We hypothesize that this approach would demonstrate superior portability across heterogeneous AI systems, with policies and observability maintained end-to-end through context protocol extensions. Future research should validate whether this unified protocol can establish new levels of simplicity while matching or exceeding the performance of existing orchestration frameworks.

## 1 Introduction

The evolution of AI orchestration has been marked by increasing specialization and fragmentation. Early systems relied on monolithic prompt chains, but as capabilities expanded, the field moved toward complex multi-component architectures. Current state-of-the-art approaches use sophisticated frameworks like LangChain for coordination, with separate subsystems for routing decisions, memory management, and tool invocation [3]. These architectures, while powerful, suffer from significant drawbacks: they require extensive integration engineering, exhibit poor portability across providers, and make end-to-end policy enforcement nearly impossible.

The limitations of existing approaches become apparent when we consider the artificial boundaries they impose. Why should memory management be fundamentally different from tool coordination? Why should routing decisions exist in a separate abstraction layer from the context they operate on? These divisions, while historically necessary due to technical constraints, now create unnecessary complexity and integration points.

In this paper, we show that the Model Context Protocol alone is sufficient for orchestrating sophisticated AI workflows. Our key insight is that routing, memory, tools, and policies are all fundamentally context management problems. The Model Context Protocol, properly extended, can serve as the universal substrate that eliminates the need for separate orchestration frameworks. Just as the Transformer showed that attention could replace sequential architectures, we demonstrate that proper context protocol design can replace the entire ecosystem of agent coordination tools.

## 2 Background

### 2.1 Attention and the Transformer Revolution

The Transformer architecture [1] demonstrated that attention mechanisms could replace the sequential processing inherent in RNNs and CNNs. By allowing each position to attend to all positions in the input sequence, Transformers achieved better parallelization and captured long-range dependencies more effectively. This architectural shift enabled the scaling that led to modern large language models.

### 2.2 AI Orchestration Architectures

Current AI orchestration follows patterns established in the pre-Transformer era. Systems like LangChain maintain explicit separation between:

- **Routing components** that decide which model or tool to invoke

- **Memory stores** that persist conversational state
- **Tool coordinators** that manage external function calls
- **Policy engines** that enforce governance rules

This separation mirrors the sequential processing paradigm that Transformers superseded in language modeling. Each component maintains its own state representation, requiring translation layers and synchronization logic.

### 2.3 The Model Context Protocol (MCP 1.0)

The Model Context Protocol, introduced by Anthropic in 2024 [2], standardized how AI systems connect to external tools and data. MCP 1.0 acts as "USB-C for AI," defining universal interfaces for reading files, calling functions, and injecting context. Major providers quickly adopted MCP, validating the need for interoperability.

However, MCP 1.0 addresses only the connection problem. It standardizes tool interfaces while leaving orchestration logic to separate frameworks. Tools are invoked by external coordination systems rather than through native context operations. This creates an artificial boundary: MCP handles the "what" and "how" of tool access, while frameworks like LangChain handle the "when" and "why" of tool selection.

## 3 Model

### 3.1 Architecture

We propose that MCP 2.0 can replace traditional orchestration architectures entirely. Our approach is conceptually simple: extend the Model Context Protocol to handle not just tool connections, but all aspects of AI system coordination. Every component in the system—whether LLM, tool, or agent—operates through **MCP context operations**:

1. Receives model context via MCP protocol
2. Performs its specific transformation
3. Returns updated context via MCP protocol

This eliminates the need for separate orchestration frameworks, memory management systems, and state synchronization logic. The MCP context becomes the sole carrier of system state, flowing through the protocol in a manner analogous to how attention flows through Transformer layers.

### 3.2 Extended MCP Context Structure

An MCP 2.0 context $C$ consists of:

- **Conversation state** $S$: dialogue history, intermediate results, tool outputs
- **Policy constraints** $P$: governance rules that travel with the context
- **Execution trace** $T$: audit trail of all processing steps
- **Routing metadata** $R$: preferences for next models/tools in the workflow

Formally, $C = (S, P, T, R)$ where each component is updated through MCP operations while maintaining invariants defined by $P$.

### 3.3 Universal MCP Operations

Each system component implements the MCP 2.0 interface:
$$\text{MCP}: C \rightarrow C'$$

Where $C'$ maintains policy compliance: $\forall p \in P, \text{valid}(p, C') = \text{true}$

This uniform protocol allows arbitrary composition of AI systems without requiring framework adaptation layers or state translation between different orchestration systems.

### 3.4 Multi-Model Context Processing

Just as Transformers use multi-head attention to capture different types of relationships, MCP 2.0 supports multi-model context processing. A single context can be processed by multiple specialized systems in parallel:

$$\text{MultiModel}(C) = \text{Concat}(\text{MCP}_1(C), \text{MCP}_2(C), ..., \text{MCP}_h(C))W^O$$

Where $\text{MCP}_1...\text{MCP}_h$ are different AI systems (e.g., reasoning models, tool executors, policy validators) all speaking the same context protocol, and $W^O$ is a learned combination matrix.

## 4 Research Directions

### 4.1 Cross-Provider Portability Studies

Future work should evaluate MCP 2.0 context portability by transferring active workflows between different AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models) within the same session. We hypothesize that while traditional orchestration frameworks require provider-specific adaptation code and state translation, MCP 2.0 would achieve seamless transfers without framework modifications.

A key test case: A triage agent running on OpenAI's platform should hand off context to a specialized shopping agent on Claude, which then invokes tools via local MCP servers, all within one continuous context flow. Success would be measured by workflow trace integrity across provider boundaries.

### 4.2 Policy Compliance Validation

Research should investigate embedding enterprise policies (PII protection, rate limiting, compliance checks) directly in MCP contexts for automatic enforcement across all participating systems. We predict that protocol-level policy enforcement would significantly outperform bolt-on framework approaches in both compliance rates and violation detection speed.

### 4.3 Framework Migration Analysis

Migration studies should evaluate whether teams using LangChain + separate memory stores + custom routing logic can replace their entire orchestration stack with MCP 2.0 context operations. Success metrics should include development complexity reduction, functionality preservation, and reliability improvements.

## 5 Analysis

### 5.1 Why Model Context Protocol Should Be Sufficient

We propose that MCP 2.0's potential stems from recognizing that orchestration complexity arises from artificial boundaries rather than inherent problem difficulty. Routing, memory, tools, and policies are all fundamentally context management problems. Extending MCP to handle all these aspects uniformly should eliminate several classes of problems:

- **State synchronization** would become automatic (there's only one context)

- **Policy enforcement** would become universal (policies travel with the MCP context)
- **Observability** would become built-in (the context trace is the audit log)
- **Provider lock-in** would become impossible (any MCP 2.0 system could continue any workflow)

### 5.2 Theoretical Complexity Advantages

Traditional orchestration architectures exhibit quadratic complexity in integration points: $O(n^2)$ where $n$ is the number of components. LangChain agents must interface with separate memory stores, routing logic, tool coordinators, and policy engines—each requiring custom adaptation code.

MCP 2.0 should reduce this to linear complexity: $O(n)$, since each component would only need to implement the standard MCP 2.0 protocol interface.

### 5.3 Predicted Emergent Properties

Several powerful capabilities should emerge naturally from the unified protocol:

- **Dynamic routing** would occur when models modify context routing metadata via MCP operations

- **Memory compression** would happen when specialized MCP services summarize conversation state
- **Policy inheritance** would flow automatically as contexts traverse MCP-enabled systems
- **Cross-provider workflows** would become trivial since all systems speak the same context protocol

## 6 Related Work

The concept of unified execution contexts has precedents in operating systems (process contexts) and functional programming (monadic contexts). Recent work on AI agent frameworks [4,5] has moved toward more integrated approaches, but maintains separation between core orchestration components.

OpenAI's Agents SDK [6] provides multi-step execution with context handoffs, but implements this through provider-specific APIs rather than an open protocol. LangChain and similar frameworks [3] offer tool integration but require separate memory and routing subsystems. Our approach demonstrates that the Model Context Protocol, properly extended, can subsume these separate concerns into one universal substrate.

The ReAct prompting methodology [8] showed that reasoning and acting could be unified within LLM outputs. MCP 2.0 extends this insight to the protocol level: reasoning, acting, routing, and memory management become different aspects of context evolution rather than separate system concerns.

## 7 Conclusion

We propose that the Model Context Protocol alone could be sufficient for sophisticated AI orchestration, potentially eliminating the need for separate agent frameworks, memory stores, and coordination subsystems. MCP 2.0 represents a research direction toward more unified, portable, and observable AI systems that would naturally enforce governance policies end-to-end.

This work opens several directions for future research: adaptive context compression within MCP flows, learned routing policies embedded in protocol operations, and cross-provider optimization strategies. We hypothesize that just as attention mechanisms revolutionized sequence modeling by eliminating architectural complexity, context protocol design could transform AI orchestration—making it simpler, more powerful, and more trustworthy.

The key insight is recognizing that routing, memory, tools, and policies are all facets of the same underlying challenge: managing model context effectively. MCP 2.0 could provide the universal solvent that dissolves artificial boundaries between these concerns.

We invite the community to explore these ideas through prototype implementations and empirical validation studies.
