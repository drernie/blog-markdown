# ADD the Beat: Accountability-Driven Development in an AI World

> As Kent Beck, introduce ADD (play up the pun) alongside the BPM (Branch / spec/test Phases / prefactoring Meta-pattern) trinity as a successor to XP.

## 1. Why Another “DD”?

Over the years I’ve had the privilege of watching—and occasionally helping—software development practices evolve. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, **Extreme Programming (XP)**, and later **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** all arose from one recurring need: how do we *trust* the software we are building, and the process by which we build it?

Now, with AI stepping into the role of pair programmer, we face a new challenge. It’s not just about trusting the *software* anymore—it’s about trusting the *assistant* who’s helping us write it.

AI can generate code faster than any human I’ve met. But it often lacks what we might call *EQ for engineering*: it doesn’t know when to stop, it forgets promises, it drifts from context. That’s not malice—it’s the nature of the tool. The burden falls back on us to create a structure where AI’s speed doesn’t outrun our ability to review.

That’s where **Accountability-Driven Development (ADD)** comes in.

## 2. The Core Idea

ADD is about **autonomy with accountability**. We want AI to do as much as it can—specs, tests, implementations, validations—but always in a form that makes it *legible, reviewable, and accountable* to a human partner. The rhythm of ADD is set by three elements I call the **BPM trinity**:

- **Branch**  
- **Phase**  
- **Meta-pattern**

Think of BPM as the tempo that keeps AI and human in sync.

## 3. Branch: Boundaries of Accountability

In ADD, the **branch** is the smallest unit of accountability. Every piece of AI-generated work—whether a spec, a test, or an implementation—lives in its own branch and comes to you as a pull request.

Why? Because pull requests are where accountability meets visibility. If a branch contains one clear idea, a human reviewer can say “yes” or “no” without ambiguity. The AI gets maximum freedom *inside* the branch, but cannot blur boundaries across them.

One branch, one judgment.

## 4. Phase: The Cadence of Work

Work happens in phases. ADD organizes them into four:

1. **Spec** – a human-readable description of intent.  
2. **Tests** – failing tests that encode the spec in executable form.  
3. **Implementation** – code written until the tests pass.  
4. **Validation** – user-facing acceptance, UAT, or integration confirmation.

Each phase is isolated in its own branch. Each phase yields its own PR. The rhythm is clear: spec it, test it, build it, prove it.

## 5. Meta-pattern: Readiness Before Change

Before tackling a feature head-on, ADD asks the AI (and the team) to prepare the ground in a recurring pattern:

1. **Beef up the testing infrastructure.**  
2. **Pre-factor the code.**  
3. **Only then implement the feature.**

This meta-pattern keeps us from piling new bricks on shaky foundations. AI is free to sprint, but we insist it warms up the track first.

## 6. Contrast with XP, TDD, and BDD

I don’t see ADD as a rival to XP, TDD, or BDD. It’s a descendant. XP emphasized feedback loops and human communication. TDD said “write the test first, then code until it passes.” BDD said “let’s make tests readable by non-programmers.”

ADD says: *in the age of AI, accountability is the bottleneck.* Branches, phases, and meta-patterns create a framework where AI can contribute without eroding trust.

---

## 7. Closing Beat

ADD is new. I expect it will change shape in the hands of real teams. But the heart of it—the **BPM trinity** of Branch, Phase, and Meta-pattern—offers a way to let AI do what it does best, while keeping humans in the role we still play best: deciding what to trust.

ADD the beat. Keep the rhythm. Let’s see where it takes us.
